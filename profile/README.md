## Hello ðŸŒŽ 
We are [Bluesight](https://bluesight.ai/), the foundational model platform company for planetary data.
We currently enable hosted inference for the [Clay model](https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model) as well as fine-tuning and serving for downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.
