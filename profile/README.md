## Hello ðŸŒŽ

We are [Bluesight](https://bluesight.ai/), the API platform for geospatial workflows, like imagery classification or segmentation.

We enable hosted inference for the [Clay foundation model](https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model) as well as its fine-tuning and serving for downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Also, we provide text and image embeddings via [SkyCLIP](https://github.com/wangzhecheng/SkyScript). Visit our [documentation](https://docs.bluesight.ai/) or check the [source code](https://github.com/bluesightai/platform) to learn about the platform's capabilities.

We also created an [Explorer](https://explorer.bluesight.ai/), where you can search for individual objects like Tesla cars or AC units within San Francisco. Feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/bluesightai/explorer).
